    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
        <h3>For the base</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300g <strong>Bread Flour</strong></li>
            <li>1 tsp <strong>Instant Yeast</strong></li>
            <li>1 tsp <strong>Salt</strong></li>

        <h3>For the tomato sauce</h3>

            <li>100ml <strong>Passata</strong></li>
            <li>Handful <strong>Fresh Basil</strong></li>
            <li>1 <strong>Garlic Clove</strong> crushed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>125g ball <strong>Mozzarella</strong> sliced</li>
            <li>Handful grated or shaved <strong>Parmesan</strong> (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
            <li>Handful of <strong>Cherry Tomatoes</strong> halved</li>
        </ul>   
        <h3>To finish</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Handful of <strong>Basil Leaves</strong> (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the base:</strong> Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll out the dough:</strong> If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        <li><strong>Top and bake:</strong> Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
